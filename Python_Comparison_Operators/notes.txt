--------- COMPARISON OPERATORS ---------
    Operators:
        ==
            If the value of two operands are equla, then the condition becomes true
                (1 == 7) returns False
        !=
            If value of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.
                (1 != 2) returns True
        > 
            If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true
                (4 > 7) returns False
        < 
            If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
                (1 < 2) returns True
        >= 
            If the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
                (4 >= 5) returns False
        <= 
            If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
                (3 <= 6) returns True


--------- CHAINING COMPARISON OPERATORS WITH LOGICAL OPERATORS ---------
    We can use logical operators to combine comparisons:
        - and
        - or
        - not
