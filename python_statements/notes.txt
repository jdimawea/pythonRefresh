--------- IF, ELIF, ELSE ---------
    Control Flow
        Executes certain code when a particular condition has been met
            ex: IF my dog is hungry (condition), then I will feed the dog (action) 
        Keywords:
            - if 
            - elif 
            - else  
        Control Flow syntax makes use of colons and indentation (whitespace)
            - if/else
                if some_condition:
                    # execute some code
                else:
                    # execute something else
            - if/elif/else 
                if some_condition:
                    # execute some code
                elif another_condition:
                    # execute different code
                else:
                    # execute something else  


--------- FOR LOOPS ---------
    Many objects in Python are 'iterable',
        Meaning we can iterate over every element in the object.
            For example: every element in a list or every character in a string or key in a dictionary
        We can use for loops to execute a block of code for every iteration
    Syntax for a for loop
        my_iterable = [1, 2, 3]
        for item_name in my_iterable:
            print(item_name)
        
        # returns  
        >>1
        >>2
        >>3


--------- WHILE LOOPS ---------
    While loops continue to execute a block of code while some conditon remains True.
        - Ex: while my pool is not full, keep filling my pool with water.
        - Ex: while my dogs are still hungry, keep feeding my dogs 
    Syntax of a while loop
        while some_boolean_condition:
            #do something
        else:
            #do something different
    break, continue, pass
        We can use, break, continue, and pass statements in our loops to add additional functionality for various cases. 
            - break: Breaks out of the current closest enclosing loop.
            - continue: Goes to the top of the closest enclosing loop. 
            - pass: Does nothing at all. 


--------- USEFUL OPERATORS ---------
    mylist = [1, 2, 3]
